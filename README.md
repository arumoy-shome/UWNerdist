# UWNerdist

UWNerdist lets fellow University of Waterloo students checkout what classes
are currently in progress or about to start on any given day.
Whether you enjoy sitting in random classes and learning about new things or if
you simply work better in a lively environment, UWNerdist can help!
The app is still under development, however here are a few features that I wish
to include in the first release:

* show classes that are about to begin or are going to end in 30 minutes or
  more relative to current time
* filter out classes that are almost full
* cache frequent results: we can do this since the schedule for a given time of
  day will be the same every week (hopefully this will turn out to be a good
  opportunity to learn about [Redis](https://redis.io))
* filter based on subject (great time to learn [elastic
  search?](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch))
* Fully tested and TDD powered codebase

A few things I hope to include in the upcoming releases:

* save favourite classes
* notifications before classes
* look back at classes attended or look forward for upcoming classes in the
  week,month or term
