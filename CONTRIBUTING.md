# Contributing #

Thank you for choosing to contribute to UWNerdist, I am really excited to see
what you have in mind. Here are a few helpful guidelines to get you started:

## How to start contributing ##

Before you begin, please make sure that you have read our [Code of
conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and GitHub's [How to contribute to open
source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) guide.

1. **Get involved in the discussions** Since this project is still in it's
   initial stages, we still have a lot of important decisions to make. You can
   shape the future of this project right now by participating in discussions
   and suggesting new features that we can work on for the first release. For
   starters, check out [this issue]() that outlines what I hope to include in
   version 1.
2. **Design** This is an open field right now, I have worked with designers
   before but am not a designer so I am looking for someone who can take a lead
   on this and drive the entire look and feel of the app. This is seriously a
   rare opportunity and if you are a designer looking to improve your skills and
   your resume, this is a great opportunity for you!
3. **Impove the docs** A contribution can be as simple as fixing a typo in the
   project docs, rewriting unclear sections or write something from scratch for
   a new feature. Doc changes do not require tests so there is no reason for you
   to not contribute!
4. **Develop** Whether you are a seasoned Rails developer or just getting
   started with coding, UWNerdist has plenty to offer. For those just getting
   started, Ruby is a great first language to learn, it's simple, robust and
   just fun to write in! Rails, the framework that I am using for this project
   (which also happens to be written in Ruby) is easy to pick up and a must to
   master if you want to work in the Ruby community. I find that these two are
   tightly coupled and so there is no reason to neglect one if you know the
   other.
   For those who are looking for a challenge, this project has only just begun
   so you get to make a lot of important engineering decisions i.e. real
   decisions that actually make a difference. If you are already familiar with
   Rails then also consider learning some front end work, I am hoping to use
   React for this project. The same goes to those who already know front end,
   there is no harm in learning some Rails.

## Setting up your development environment ##
If you have decided to contribute by writing some code or want to browse the
source code, you must set up a development environment on your local machine,
here is how you do that.




 To make a feature
request do the following:

1. Create a new [GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
2. Give it a constructive and meaningful title
3. Explain your idea in detail, include ample amounts of context and background
   when needed. Screenshots are welcome!
4. This guide on [How to write in
   markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) might come in handy.
