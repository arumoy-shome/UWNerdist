# Contributing #

Thank you for choosing to contribute to UWNerdist, I am really excited to see
what you have in mind. Here are a few helpful guidelines to get you started:

Since this project is still in it's initial stages, I won't be accepting any
pull requests at this time (this will probably be the case until the first
release). However, feature requests and suggests are more than welcome!

Before you begin, please make sure that you have read our [Code of
conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and GitHub's [How to contribute to open
source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) guide. To make a feature
request do the following:

1. Create a new [GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
2. Give it a constructive and meaningful title
3. Explain your idea in detail, include ample amounts of context and background
   when needed. Screenshots are welcome!
4. This guide on [How to write in
   markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) might come in handy.
